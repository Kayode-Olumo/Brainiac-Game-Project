# Brainiac-Game-Project

## What is it?

This game seeks to test memory of the player and how well they can retain information.
 
## Mission
Match all the cards before timer runs out and with the least number of moves. Top tier players will be able to complete the game all their lives intact.  

## How to play
1.	Click on a card to reveal an image.
2.	Complete clicking cards until you find a matching pair.
3.	To reduce the number of move and time taken, try to create a mental picture of where images are placed.  

## How it was built
This project was developed using the following technologies:
### HTMl
* For basic structuring and layout of the UI
### CSS
* For positioning and styling of the application
### JavaScript (Vanilla)
For the creation of the logic and functionality behind the game. Those functions include:
* Randomly generated card on the board.
*	Ability to flip the cards, with validation if the cards do not match
*	A way of tracking the lives, time and moves
*	A pop up box displaying the result of the game played and whether the player was successful are not.

All of which were used to manipulate various elements in the DOM.
